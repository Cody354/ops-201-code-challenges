# Purpose:                     

# Write a script that:
# Displays running processes
# Asks the user for a PID
# Kills the process with that PID


# Starts over at step 1 and continues until the user exits with Ctrl + C


# Use a loop so that the script will continuously start over, displaying the running processes, 
# asking the user for input, etc.


# For this assignment, initialize a process that won’t harm the OS’s functionality upon termination. Don’t kill essential processes required for the OS to work, such as kernel drivers.
# Hint: you can open a second terminal in your development environment and start it pinging one of your other machines. This will be a safe process to target.


# Stretch Goals: Include a step which asks the user if they would like to kill again, 
# and if they indicate they do, causes the script to finish.

# Main.
